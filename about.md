  <p class="intro">Welcome to the corner of the internet where I, Cai Tuo, collect reflections on software, creativity, and the journeys in between.</p>
  <p>I build products, write about the lessons I learn along the way, and chase the same sense of clarity you get when hiking into crisp alpine air. This blog is a place to share ideas, document experiments, and celebrate the people and landscapes that inspire careful craftsmanship.</p>
  <p>Expect deep dives into engineering topics, thoughtful notes on personal growth, and the occasional story about adventures in nature. If those themes resonate with you, I am glad you're hereâ€”explore the posts, share your thoughts, and let's keep the conversation going.</p>
