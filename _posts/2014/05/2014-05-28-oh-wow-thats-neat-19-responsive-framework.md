<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith all of the great frameworks popping up it can be difficult to choose the "right" one. Besides doing some really great things, probably the two most popular frameworks [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) and [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), can be a little overreaching at times when it comes to theming them. You may find that you have to overwrite and undo many styles to make them look unique. This is where web developer [James South's](https://twitter.com/James_M_South) [Responsive Boilerplate](http://responsivebp.com/) may prove to be that "right" one.</p>

## [Responsive Boilerplate](http://responsivebp.com/)

Responsive has many of the elements that you know and love from other popular frameworks but the key difference is that they are given only the most basic styling. This means that you wont have to overwrite and undo as much and can more efficiently add your theme layer.

It is extremely light weight at only 20.6kb minified and gzipped. The goal is to keep it small and in return this will help keep your code small since you won't really need to peel out the theme of the framework itself just to add your own look.

It is intended to be dropped into your sites similar to how you would a [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) file.
